%
% If you use the software for research purposes I kindly ask you to cite
% the following paper:
%
%    T. Lampert, A. Stumpf, and P. Gancarski, 'An Empirical Study of Expert 
%       Agreement and Ground Truth Estimation', IEEE Transactions on Image
%       Processing 25 (6): 2557â€“2572, 2016.
%
%
% Runs through all of the LIDC scans within the directory specified by 
% LIDC_path and converts the XML annotations into GT images, along with the
% corresponding masks and slice images (if the images are present). The 
% results are put in the specified output_path under:
%
%   $output_path$/gts/$StudyInstanceID$/
%   $output_path$/images/$StudyInstanceID$/
%   $output_path$/masks/$StudyInstanceID$/
%
% Where $StudyInstanceID$ is the ID found within the DICOM minus the
% '1.3.6.1.4.1.14519.5.2.1.6279.6001.', which is constant within the
% dataset. An additional file names slice_info.txt is output within each of
% the above directories that contain the slice number, SOPInstanceUID and 
% DICOM filename correspondances.
%
% These functions only extract the slice images, GTs and masks for those 
% scan slices that have annotations associated with them.
%
% If you get an error similar to "Can't locate XML/Twig.pm" then you either 
% need to install the correct Perl packges required by MAX (see next 
% paragraph) or need to set the perl_library_path variable in 
% LIDC_convert_xml_2_mat.m to the location of the perl libraries (not 
% needed if using Windows).
%
% Requires PERL to be installed (MAX uses this) along with the following
% packages (see readme):
% 
%    XML::Twig
%    XML::Parser
%    Math::Polygon::Calc
%    Tie::IxHash
%
% NOTE TO USERS: I cannot guarantee that slicing distances and other
% anatomical data is preserved during this conversion (these functions rely
% on MAX to calculate all of this and I don't know whether I provide MAX 
% with enough information for this to be done reliably). I've tried my best
% to do things 'to-the-book' but I am not entirely familiar with the LIDC
% protocol.
%
% I've tested this on the first 100 LIDC files (LIDC-IDRI-0001 -
% LIDC-IDRI-0100) and all seems to be ok...
%
% The DCM and XML files corresponding to the same scan should be in the
% same directory, one directory for each scan (as is the structure of the
% original data). If the only the XML files are used then the masks and
% images will not be created and the GTs will not be in the order of the
% scan.
